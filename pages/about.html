				<p>Thom "Spebby" Mott is a California based university student and part-time developer focused on interactive digital media specialising in Game AI and Computer Graphics. As an undergrad, Thom was affiliated with the <a href="https://setlab.soe.ucsc.edu/" style="font-style:italic;">SET lab</a> and <a href="https://slothlab.info/about/index.html" style="font-style:italic;">SLOTHLab</a>, where he contributed to the development of "Compassionate AR", and "Procedural Content Generation in Minecraft". This, and his personal work has lead him to draw on a breadth of creative influences, taking from both technical and human-centred approaches.</p>

				<p>Outside of academics, Thom has been working on and around games for over a decade, getting started with video game modding in the 2010's, releasing multiple officially endorsed 'curated' maps for the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304930/Unturned/" style="font-style:italic;">Unturned</a>, where he got his start in game and level design. At the same time, he has published several games in collaboration with fellow modders on <a href="https://spebby.newgrounds.com/" style="font-style:italic;">Newgrounds</a>, and is currently working on the upcoming action-roguelike <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3497930/Gamba_Gun/">Gamba Gun</a>.</p>

				<p>I am Thom Mott, a hopeful masters student for the Computational Media M.S. @ UCSC, and a current undergraduate in Computer Science: Game Design B.S. @ UCSC. My focus is on game development, computer graphics and game AI, often mixing these focuses for any given project. I have experience as a researcher in HCI from my time in undergrad.</p>
				<p>Prior—and during—my time at university, I was an active modder for the video game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304930/Unturned/">Unturned</a>, where I got acquainted with level design and developed my game designer abilities.</p>
				<p>You can read more about me on my <a href="/About/">about</a> page!</p>
